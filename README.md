# Left View of Binary Tree

## 📌 Overview
This project demonstrates the **Left View of a Binary Tree** concept.  
The left view of a binary tree contains the nodes that are visible when the tree is viewed from the **left side**. For each level of the tree, only the **leftmost node** is included in the left view.

This repository provides a simple and easy-to-understand explanation and implementation using a web-based interface.

## 🌳 What is Left View of a Binary Tree?
The left view consists of:
- One node per level
- The first node encountered when traversing from the left side

# Binary Search Tree Traversal Visualizer 🌳

## 📌 Overview
This project demonstrates **Binary Search Tree (BST) traversals** using an interactive and visual approach.  
Users can build a BST by entering values and then observe how different traversal algorithms visit nodes step by step.

## 🌲 What is a Binary Search Tree?
A **Binary Search Tree (BST)** is a binary tree where:
- Left subtree contains values **less than** the root
- Right subtree contains values **greater than** the root
- Each subtree is also a BST

## 🔄 Traversal Methods Implemented

### 1️⃣ Inorder Traversal (Left → Root → Right)
- Visits nodes in **sorted order** in a BST  
- Commonly used to retrieve sorted data

### 2️⃣ Preorder Traversal (Root → Left → Right)
- Visits root first, then subtrees
- Useful for copying trees and prefix expressions

### 3️⃣ Postorder Traversal (Left → Right → Root)
- Visits children before the root
- Used for deleting trees and postfix expressions

### 4️⃣ Level Order Traversal (Breadth-First Search)
- Visits nodes level by level
- Used in shortest path and hierarchical processing
